======================= steps to create a documentation using sphinx =========================

# Check your sys paths first
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

if your project path is not available than add it using following command. In my case my project folder name is "new_gbir_pipeline", so I added following path.

# Add new sys path
export PYTHONPATH=$/Users/pratikdomadiya/PycharmProjects/testCode/new_gbir_pipeline

if you are in testCode dir:  For ex. Your project directory located at : /users/testCode/your_project_folder/

Go to testCode dir >> 
- cd testCode
- mkdir docs
- cd docs
- sphinx-quickstart

Go to your conf.py file and uncomment line numbers 13,14 and 15. Change the os.path.abspath('.') to os.path.abspath('..'). Here, we tell sphinx that the code is residing outside of the current docs folder.

Now go to the extensions part and add the extensions given below.

extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'sphinx.ext.napoleon'
]

- Lastly, go to themes and replace ‘alabaster’ with ‘sphinx_rtd_theme’

- cd .. # go to testCode dir
- sphinx-apidoc -o docs ./new_gbir_pipeline
- cd docs
- make html
